I create 6 random configurations of 4*4 (there are 2^16 =65536 possible configurations).
I run them and rank them by their maximum evaluation which is black_cells / gridSize ** 2.(percent of black cells)
Then I do the next 3 times:
	choose two parents, each configuraiton is chosen by a chance of P(i) = (evaluation of configuration i) / sum of evaluations of all of the configurations,
	(I don't allow the same configuration to merge with itself)
	and then I merge them this way: A1 - upper part of A , A2- lower part of A, B1- upper part of A,B2 - lower part of B
	A1 B1 -> A1 B1 (each column is the newly merged child)
	A2 B2 -> B2 A2
	
	for the first couple the mutation rate of each cell in the two children is 0.1, 
	for the second couple is 0.2
	for the first couple is 0.3

and I repeat this proccesss as much as I want to get a better result.
